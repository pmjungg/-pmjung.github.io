        hisense touch review
    </title>
</head>


<body>

    <pre>
        back in march of 2023, I decided to purchase the hisense touch, after my kindle paperwhite ($150) had failed.
        it's been over an year since I had this device and I wanted to write about it. this device was bought on aliexpress for about $210,
        but now the price is at around $260 for the hisense touch lite (the seller with high reviews)
        and the hisense touch at around $290. ever since I had purchased this device, I was able to read 45 books 
        in 2023, while in 2022, I red 3 books.

    <p>
        pros:
    <ul>

        <li>
            even though this device is a chinese device, I didn't have many issue with using it. I got most apps
            working
        </li>

        <li>
            the sound quality is great, had no issues with it
        </li>

        <li>
            battery lasts for a few days if you're not using it all day
        </li>

        <li>
            it is a bit fast for a e-ink device, I was quite surprised
        </li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
        cons:
    <ul>

        <li>
            I used tachiyomi, a manga reading app. I wouldn't recommend reading manga on this device because
            of how small the text is
        </li>

        <li>
            no sd card slot
        </li>

        <li>
            no camera
        </li>

    </ul>

    </p>
