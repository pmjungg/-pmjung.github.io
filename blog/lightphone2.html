        light phone 2 review
    </title>
</head>


<body>

    <pre>
        decided to buy this device a few months ago when I saw it selling for $140 on eBay.
        the original cost for the device only is over $300. I had my eyes on the light phone 2 for a long time,
        but never bought it because first, I was afraid that I wouldn't like the device and second, I
        wasn't willingly to pay 300 bucks to try the device out. turns out that I really like and hate the
        device for few reasons, but I still love that the designed the device to be used as little as possible.

    <p>
        these are all the tools that light phone 2 have: phone, alarm, calendar, timer, directions, directory, notes,
        podcast, music, calculator, hotspot, and settings.

    <p>
        main issues that I wish I didn't have to deal with:
    <ul>

        <li>
            pause/play function doesn't work on bluetooth device and yes, I tried different wireless earbuds, but they
            never work (meanwhile the function does work on other devices)
        </li>

        <li>
            music: cannot upload larger mp3 files for some reason, while few minute mp3 files are uploaded easily
        </li>

        <li>
            battery life drains a lot even when I don't use it throughout the day
        </li>

    </ul>
